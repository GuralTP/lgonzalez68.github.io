# Kyoto Fushimi Inari Shrine
---
One of my favorite things about visiting and living in 
Japan is being able to 
visit the Fushimi Inari Shrine.

After many years of wishing to visit this place, I was finally afforded the opportunity to visit it. 
I was very excited to see
the  tall Torrii gates and walk through them. Finally arriving to a vast bamboo forest at 
the end of one the trails, I carved my name into one of the trees, just like many others, to be able to comeback 
and see if its still there.
